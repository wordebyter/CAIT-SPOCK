Queens increased by 16,075 Brooklyn's population increased by 11, 870 more than Queens. This means figuring out Brooklyn's population involves adding 11 870 + 16,075 = 27,945 The problem is asking you to estimate the total combined population increase of Queens and Brooklyn. 16,075 + 27, 945 You can estimate the total population by rounding up to the nearest 1000. If below 500, round down, if above 500 round up. 16,000 +30,000 = 46.000","[

"Lin missed math class on the day they worked on expanding and factoring. Kiran is helping Lin catch up. Lin understands that expanding is using the distributive property, but she doesn't understand what factoring is or why it works. How can Kiran explain factoring to Lin? Copied for free from openupresources.org",In order to factor you need to look at the numbers and think about what is the greatest common factor that will go into those numbers. For example: 30x + 9 The common factor would be 3. 310x + 3 After you find the common factor you then need to put that number in front of the parenthesis The numbers that go inside the parenthesis are the numbers that you multiply by to equal the original expression. 12x - 4 = 43x -1,"[

"Find a number that matches the description. A 4-digit number that is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 10. The Utah Middle School Math Project","There are many different correct answers to this question. We want a number that is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 10. To be divisible by 2, the last digit must be an even number or 0. To be divisible by 3, the digits must sum to a number that is a multiple or 3. To be divisible by 5, the last digit has to be a 0 or a 5. To be divisible by 10, the last digit must be a 0. If we want our number to not be divisible by 2, 5, or 10, then the last digit cannot be an even number, 0, or 5. This leaves 1, 3, 7, and 9. For our example, we'll pick 7 _ _ _ 7 Finally, let's pick our other three digits so that all four digits do not add to a number divisible by 3.

What causes a repeating decimal in the long division algorithm?,"When following the long division algorithm, you basically divide, multiply, subtract and bring down. Many times, after you subtract, there is a remainder. If, after you subtract, you end up with the same remainder as the time before, and you are bringing down the same number as before, you will find that the algorithm will just keep producing the same digit in the quotient over and over again because you are dividing the same number over and over again. This causes a repeating decimal. As soon as you recognize this pattern, you can stop dividing because you will know that the digits in the quotient will continue to repeat on and on and on.","[{

If we count from -5 to 5 ex: -5, -4, -3, -2..., we know that we will need 11 tick marks. We can draw 11 tick marks, equally spaced, along our line. If our line is 11 cm long, then there can be a tick mark starting at 0, and one at every centimeter mark after that. We know that -5 goes with the tick mark at the left end of the line. We know that 5 goes with the tick mark at the right end of the line. We know that 0 must go on the middle tick mark, since it is halfway between -5 and 5.

Then she assigned 2 more problems to one of the students. 27 problems were assigned in all. Write an equation for the story.,"Let x be the number of problems the teacher assigned to all of the five students. An additional two problems are assigned to one of the students. So, an expression for the number of problems assigned would be 5x + 2. Also, we are given the total number of problems assigned, which is 27 problems. Now, we can set the expression equal to 27.

Here is an equation that is true for all values of x: 5x + 2 = 5x + 10. Elena saw this equation and says she can tell 20x + 2 + 31 = 45x + 10 + 31 is also true for any value of x. How can she tell? Explain your reasoning.,"Elena can tell that the equation, 20x + 2 + 31 = 45x + 10 + 31, is true for any value of x, because both sides of the equation are equal and will cancel out. While the two sides do not look equal at first, the equation can be rearranged using the distributive property. First the equation can be simplified to make it easier to compare both sides. 20x + 2 + 31 = 45x + 10 + 31 Both sides have 31 being added to them so that term cancels out after subtracting 31 from both sides. 20x + 2 = 45x + 10 Within the parenthesis on the right both terms are multiples of 5, so using the distributive property, a 5 can be taken out of the parenthesis. 20x + 2 = 4*5x + 2 20x + 2 = 20x + 2 Since both sides are the same, each term will cancel out and the equation will eventually simplify to 0 = 0, making all values of x true.","[

Callie and Jeff each have a job delivering newspapers. Jeff gets paid 140 dollars for delivering 350 papers. Callie gets paid 100 for delivering 200 papers. Find the unit rate for Callie The Utah Middle School Math Project,"The unit rate can be either the amount of dollars for every one newspaper or the amount of newspapers for every one dollar. Unlike a regular rate, unit rates have a 1 in the denominator. To turn a rate into a unit rate, divide the numerator by the denominator. The rate that Callie was delivering papers is 100 per 200 papers or 100/200 papers. To get the unit rate divide 100 by 200 to get unit rate of 0.50/paper 0.50 is the unit rate of dollars to papers The rate that Callie delivered can also be expressed in papers per dollars. The rate would be 200 papers per 100. By simplifying the rate a unit rate of 2 papers per dollar is found. 2 is the unit rate of papers to dollars.","[{

Callie and Jeff each have a job delivering newspapers. Jeff gets paid 140 dollars for delivering 350 papers. Callie gets paid 100 for delivering 200 papers. Find the unit rate for Callie The Utah Middle School Math Project,"The unit rate can be either the amount of dollars for every one newspaper or the amount of newspapers for every one dollar. Unlike just a rate, unit rates have a 1 in the denominator. To turn a rate into a unit rate, divide the numerator by the denominator. The rate that Callie was delivering papers is 100 per 200 papers or 100/200 papers. To get the unit rate divide 100 by 200 to get unit rate of 0.50/paper 0.50 is the unit rate of dollars to papers The rate that Callie delivered can also be expressed in papers per dollars. The rate would be 200 papers per 100. By simplifying the rate a unit rate of 2 papers per dollar is found. 2 is the unit rate of papers to dollars.","[

Solution: part: 680 percent: 15% = 0.15 We want to find the original price of the laptop. Note that with a 15% discount, the final price of 680 is 85% of the original price. 85% of the original price is 0.85 times the original price. With this information, we can write: 680 = original price x 0.85 Now, we can solve for the original price: 680 = original price x 0.85 680/0.85 = original price 800 = original price We get that the original price of the laptop Tom bought was 800.","[{

Ed burns 500 calories an hour running. He burns 650 calories an hour biking.

"Here, write the fourth problem in which the percent and the whole are known, but the part is not known, and its solution. The Utah Middle School Math Project","Sample Answer: Justin bought 8 bags of chips when he went grocery shopping. On his way back home, he ate 37.5% of the chips. How many bags of chips did Justin eat? Solution: whole: 8 bags percent: 37.5% = 0.375 To find the number of bags of chips Justin ate on his way home, we multiply the whole by the percent: whole x percent = 8 bags x 0.375 = 3 bags We get that Justin ate 3 bags of the chips on his way home.","[{

In the first hour of work, he drank 6 fl. oz. of the tea, which was 25% of the tea he prepared. How many fluid ounces of tea did he prepare? Solution: part: 6 fl.oz. percent: 25% = 0.25 We want to find the amount of tea Richard prepared started with. Note that 25% of the original amount is 6 fl. oz. 25% of the original amount is 0.25 times the original amount.

Solution: part: 6 fl.oz. percent: 25% = 0.25 We want to find the amount of tea Richard prepared started with. Note that 25% of the original amount is 6 fl. oz. 25% of the original amount is 0.25 times the original amount. With this information, we can write: 6 fl. oz. = original amount x 0.25 Now, we can solve for the original price: 6 fl. oz. = original amount x 0.25 6 fl. oz./0.25 = original amount 24 fl. oz. = original amount We get that Richard prepared 24 fl. oz. of tea.","[{
